# damascus

Damascus is a ray marcher/path tracer with a node-based gui, written entirely in Rust and WGSL.
This is very much still a work in progress, and future breaking changes are all but guaranteed.

### Running the project

Simply clone the repo and run `cargo run --release` to build and launch the application.
